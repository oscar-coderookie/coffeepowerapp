Seccion Quienes somos? : About Us:

We are a family-owned company born from a deep passion for coffee and nutrition. We carefully select 100% Arabica beans from exclusive farms in Colombia and from the most prestigious coffee-growing regions of the tropical belt worldwide—legendary lands renowned for cultivating the most exquisite coffee on the planet.

Our journey began with a clear dream: to discover the perfect coffee, one that not only delights the palate but also enhances well-being. After years of traveling the world, learning, and experimenting, we have created unique and exclusive recipes, the result of a meticulous selection of the most exceptional beans from each region, blending their flavors into unparalleled harmonies. This passion for excellence has led many of our friends and clients to describe Coffee Power as “the coffee of the Gods.”

At Coffee Power, we are constantly innovating and exploring new ratios and extraction methods. We are currently working on a revolutionary and unique technique that will elevate the coffee drinking experience to a level never seen before, with the vision of making it a global reference—just as Espresso (Italy, 1901) and the French Press (France, 1929) once did.

Every sip of Coffee Power transports you to a unique and unrepeatable sensory universe, born from absolute dedication and an unbreakable commitment to quality. Because Coffee Power is not just coffee—it is our passion transformed into art, crafted by an artist you will soon discover.
